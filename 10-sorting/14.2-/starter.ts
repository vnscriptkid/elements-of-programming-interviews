// MERGE TWO SORTED ARRAYS

// Suppose you are given two sorted arrays of integers. If one array has enough empty entries at its end,
// it can be used to store the combined entries of the two arrays in sorted order.
// For example, consider (5,13,17,_,_,_,_,_) and (3,7,11,19), where _ denotes an empty entry.
// Then the combined sorted entries can be stored in the first array as(3,5,7,11,13,17,19,_).

// Write a program which takes as input two sorted arrays of integers,
// and updates the first to the combined entries of the two arrays in sorted order.
// Assume the first array has enough empty entries at its end to hold the result.
