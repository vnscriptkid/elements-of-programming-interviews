// TEAM PHOTO DAYâ€”1

// You are a photographer for a soccer meet.
// You will be taking pictures of pairs of opposing teams.
// All teams have the same number of players.
// A team photo consists of a front row of players
// and a back row of players. A player in the back row must
// be taller than the player in front of him, as illustrated in Figure 14.3.
// All players in a row must be from the same team.
