// IMPLEMENT A STACK API USING A HEAP

// We discussed the notion of reduction when describing problem solving patterns.
// Usually, reductions are used to solve a more complex problem using a solution to a simpler problem as a subroutine.

// Occasionally it makes sense to go the other wayâ€”for example,
// if we need the functionality of a heap, we can use a BST library, which is more commonly available,
// with modest performance penalties with respect, for example, to an array-based implementation of a heap.

// How would you implement a stack API using a heap?
