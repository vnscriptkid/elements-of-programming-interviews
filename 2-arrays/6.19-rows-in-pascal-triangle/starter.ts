// 6.19 COMPUTE ROWS IN PASCAL'S TRIANGLE

// Figure 6.5 shows the first five rows of a graphic that is known as Pascal's triangle.
// Each row contains one more entry than the previous one. Exceptfor entriesin the last
// row, each entry is adjacent to one or two numbersin the row below it. The first row
// holds 1. Each entry holds the sum of the numbersin the adjacent entries above it.
// Write a program which takes asinput a nonnegative integer n and returns the first n
// rows of Pascal's triangle.
