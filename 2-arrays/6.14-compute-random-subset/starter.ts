// 6.14 COMPUTE A RANDOM SUBSET
// The set {0,1, 2,..., n- 1) has(”) = «!/((« - k)\k\) subsets of size k. We seek to design
// an algorithm that returns any one of these subsets with equal probability.
// Write a program that takes asinput a positive integer n and a size k < n,and returns
// a size-k subset of {0,1,2,...,n -1). The subsetshould be represented as an array. All
// subsetsshould be equally likely and, in addition, all permutations of elements of the
// array should be equally likely. You may assume you have a function which takes as
// input a nonnegative integer t and returns an integer in the set {0, 1, . . . ,t - 1) with
// uniform probability.
