// ADVANCING THROUGH AN ARRAY

// Write a program which takes an array of n integers,
// where A[i] denotes the maximum you can advance from index i,
// and returns whether it is possible to advance to the last index starting from the beginning of the array.

// Forexample,letA =(3,3,1,0,2,0,1} represent the board game,
// i.e., the ith entry in A is the maximum we can advance from i.
// Then the game can be won by the following sequence of advances through A:
// take 1 step from A[0] to A[1], then 3 steps from A[l] to A[4], then 2 steps from A[4] to A[6],
// which is the last position.
// Note that A[0] = 3 > 1, A[l] = 3 > 3, and A[4] = 2 > 2,
// so all moves are valid. If A instead was (3, 2, 0,0, 2, 0,1),
// it would not possible to advance past position 3, so the game cannot be won.
