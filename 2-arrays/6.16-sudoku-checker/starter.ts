// 6.16 THE SUDOKU CHECKER PROBLEM

// Sudoku is a popular logic-based combinatorial number placement puzzle. The objecÂ¬
// tive istofill a 9X9 grid with digitssubject to the constraint that each column, each row,
// and each of the nine 3x3sub-grids that compose the grid contains unique integers
// in [1,9]. The grid isinitialized with a partial assignment asshown in Figure 6.2(a) on
// the following page; a complete solution isshown in Figure 6.2(b) on the next page.
// Check whether a 9 X 9 2D array representing a partially completed Sudoku is valid.
// Specifically, check that no row, column, or 3 X 3 2D subarray contains duplicates. A
// 0-value in the 2D array indicates that entry is blank; every other entry isin [1,9].
