// 6.17 COMPUTE THE SPIRAL ORDERING OF A 2D ARRAY

// A 2D array can be written as a sequence in several ordersâ€”the most natural ones
// being row-by-row or column-by-column. In this problem we explore the problem
// of writing the 2D array in spiral order. For example, the spiral ordering for the 2D
// array in Figure 6.3(a) is (1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5). For Figure 6.3(b), the spiral ordering is
// <1, 2,3, 4,8,12,16,15,14,13,9,5, 6, 7,11,10).

// Write a program which takes an nxn 2D array and returns the spiral ordering of the
// array

export function matrixInSpiralOrder(squareMatrix: number[][]): number[] {
    return []
}
