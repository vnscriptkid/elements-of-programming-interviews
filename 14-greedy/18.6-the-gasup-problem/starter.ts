// In the gasup problem, a number of cities are arranged on a circular road.
// You need to visit all the cities and come back to the starting city.
// A certain amount of gas is available at each city.
// The amount of gas summed up over all cities is equal to the amount of gas
// required to go around the road once. Your gas tank has unlimited capacity.

// Call a city ample if you can begin at that city with an empty tank, refill at it,
// then travel through all the remaining cities, refilling at each, and return to the ample city,
// without running out of gas at any point. See Figure 18.2 for an example.

// Given an instance of the gasup problem, how would you efficiently compute an ample city?
// You can assume that there exists an ample city.

// 20 miles / gallon
