// THE INTERVAL COVERING PROBLEM

// Consider a foreman responsible for a number of tasks on the factory floor.
// Each task starts at a fixed time and ends at a fixed time.
// The foreman wants to visit the floor to check on the tasks.
// Your job is to help him minimize the number of visits he makes.
// In each visit, he can check on all the tasks taking place at the time of the visit.
// A visit takes place at a fixed time, and he can only check on tasks taking place at exactly that time.

// For example, if there are tasks at times [0,3],[2,6],[3,4],[6,9],
// then visit times 0,2,3,6 cover all tasks.
// A smaller set of visit times that also cover all tasks is 3,6.
// In the abstract, you are to solve the following problem.

// You are given a set of closed intervals.
// Design an efficient algorithm for finding a minimum sized set of numbers that covers all the intervals.
