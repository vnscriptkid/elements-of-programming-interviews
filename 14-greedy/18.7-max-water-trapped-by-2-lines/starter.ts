// COMPUTE THE MAXIMUM WATER TRAPPED BY A PAIR OF VERTICAL LINES

// An array of integers naturally defines a set of lines parallel to the Y-axis,
// starting from x = 0 as illustrated in Figure 18.4(a).
// The goal of this problem is to find the pair of lines that together with the X-axis "trap" the most water.
// See Figure 18.4(b) for an example.
