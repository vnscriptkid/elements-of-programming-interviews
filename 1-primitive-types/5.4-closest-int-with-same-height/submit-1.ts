// 5.4 FIND A CLOSEST INTEGER WITH THE SAME WEIGHT
// Define the weight of a nonnegative integer x to be the number of bits that are set to
// 1 in its binary representation. For example, since 92 in base-2 equals (1011100)2, the
// weight of 92 is 4.
// Write a program which takes asinput a nonnegative integer x and returns a number
// y which is not equal to x,but has the same weight as x and their difference,|y - x\,is
// assmall as possible. You can assume x is not 0, or all Is. For example, if x = 6, you
// should return 5.

export function closestIntSameBitCount(x: number): number {
    // 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 => 93
    return 90;
