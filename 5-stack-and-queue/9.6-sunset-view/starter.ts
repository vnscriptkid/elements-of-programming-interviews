// COMPUTE BUILDINGS WITH A SUNSET VIEW

// You are given with a series of buildings that have windows facing west.
// The buildings are in a straight line, and any building
// which is to the east of a building of equal or greater height cannot view the sunset.

// Design an algorithm that processes buildings in east-to-west order and
// returns the set of buildings which view the sunset. Each building is specified by its height.
