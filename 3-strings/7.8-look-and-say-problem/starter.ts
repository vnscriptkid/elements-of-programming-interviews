// 7.8 THE LOOK-AND-SAY PROBLEM

// The look-and-say sequence starts with 1.
// Subsequent numbers are derived by describing the previous number in terms of consecutive digits.
// Specifically, to generate an entry of the sequence from the previous entry, r
// ead off the digits of the previous entry, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

// For example, 1; one 1; two Is; one 2 then one 1; one 1, then one 2, then two Is; three Is,
// then two 2s, then one 1.
//The first eight numbers in the look-and-say sequence are <1,11, 21,1211,111221,312211,13112221,1113213211>.

// Write a program that takes as input an integer n and
// returns the nth integer in the look-and-say sequence. Return the result as a string.
