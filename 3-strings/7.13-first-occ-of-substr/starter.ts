// 7.13 FIND THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF A SUBSTRING

// A good string search algorithm is fundamental to the performance of many applications.
// Several clever algorithms have been proposed for string search, each with its
// own trade-offs. As a result, there is no single perfect answer. If someone asks you this
// question in an interview, the best way to approach this problem would be to work
// through one good algorithm in detail and discuss at a high level other algorithms.

// Given two stringss(the "search string") and t (the "text"), find the first occurrence of s in t.
// Hint: Form a signature from a string.

// Returns the index of the first character of the substring if found , -1
// otherwise.
