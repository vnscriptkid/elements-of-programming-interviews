// TEST PALINDROMICITY

// For the purpose of this problem, define a palindromic string to be a string which
// when all the nonalphanumeric are removed it reads the same front to back ignoring case.
// For example, "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama."
// and "Able was I, ere I saw Elba!" are palindromic, but "Ray a Ray" is not.
