// 17.8 FINDTHE MINIMUM WEIGHT PATH IN A TRIANGLE

// A sequence of integer arrays in which the nth array consists of n entries naturally
// corresponds to a triangle of numbers. See Figure 17.10 for an example.
// Figure 17.10: Anumbertriangle.

// Define a path in the triangle to be a sequence of entries in the triangle
// in which adjacent entries in the sequence correspond to entries that are adjacent
// in the triangle. The path must start at the top, descend the triangle continuously,
// and end with an entry on the bottom row. The weight of a path is the sum of the entries.

// Write a program that takes as input a triangle of numbers and returns
// the weight of a minimum weight path. For example,
// the minimum weight path for the number triangle in Figure 17.10 is shown in bold face,
// and its weight is 15.

export function minimumPathTotal(triangle: number[][]) {}
