// 17.9 PICK UP COINS FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

// In the pick-up-coins game, an even number of coins are placed in a line, as in Fig¬
// ure 17.11. Two players take turns at choosing one coin each—they can only choose
// from the two coins at the ends of the line. The game ends when all the coins have
// been picked up. The player whose coins have the higher total value wins. A player
// cannot pass his turn.

// Design an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum total value for the starting
// player in the pick-up-coins game.
