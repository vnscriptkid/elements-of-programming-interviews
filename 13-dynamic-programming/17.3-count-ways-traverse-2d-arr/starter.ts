// COUNT THE NUMBER OF WAYS TO TRAVERSE A 2D ARRAY

// In this problem you are to count the number of ways of
// starting at the top-left comer of a 2D array and getting to the bottom-right comer.
// All moves must either go right or down.

// For example, we show three ways in a 5 X 5 2D array in Figure 17.5.
// (As we will see, there are a total of 70 possible ways for this example.)

function numberOfWays(n: number, m: number) {}
