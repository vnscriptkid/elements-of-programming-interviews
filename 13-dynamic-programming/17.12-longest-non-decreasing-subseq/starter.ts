// 17.12 FIND THE LONGEST NONDECREASING SUBSEQUENCE

// The problem of finding the longest nondecreasing subsequence in a sequence of inteÂ¬
// gers has implications to many disciplines, including string matching and analyzing
// card games.

// As a concrete instance, the length of a longest nondecreasing
// subsequence for the array in Figure 17.15 is 4. There are multiple longest nondecreasing
// subsequences,

// e.g., (0,4,10,14} and (0, 2,6,9). Note that elements of non-decreasing
// subsequence are not required to immediately follow each other in the original sequence

// Write a program that takes asinput an array of numbers and returns the length of a
// longest nondecreasing subsequence in the array.
