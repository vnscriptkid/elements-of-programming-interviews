// COMPUTE THE LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE

// Spell checkers make suggestions for misspelled words. Given a misspelled string, a spell checker should return words in the dictionary which are close to the misspelled string.

// In 1965, Vladimir Levenshtein defined the distance between two words as the minimum number of "edits"
// it would take to transform the misspelled word into a correct word, where a single edit is
// the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character. For example,
// the Levenshtein distance between "Saturday" and "Sundays" is 4â€”delete
// the first 'a' and 't', substitute V by 'n' and insert the trailing 's'.

// Write a program that takes two strings and computes the minimum number of edits
// needed to transform the first string into the second string.

export function levenshteinDistance(a: string, b: string) {}
