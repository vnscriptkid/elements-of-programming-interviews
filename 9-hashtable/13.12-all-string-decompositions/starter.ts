// 13.12 COMPUTE ALL STRING DECOMPOSITIONS

// This problem is concerned with taking a string (the "sentence" string) and a set
// of strings (the "words"), and finding the substrings of the sentence which are the
// concatenation of all the words (in any order). For example, if the sentence string
// is "amanaplanacanal" and the set of words is {"can","apl","ana"), "aplanacan" is a
// substring of the sentence that is the concatenation of all words.

// Write a program which takes asinput a string (the "sentence") and an array of strings
// (the "words"), and returns the starting indices of substrings of the sentence string

export function findAllSubstrings(s: string, words: string[]): number[] {
    return [];
