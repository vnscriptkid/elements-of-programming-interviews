// FIND THE kth LARGEST ELEMENT

// Many algorithms require as a subroutine the computation of the kth largest element of an array.
// The first largest element is simply the largest element.
// The nth largest element is the smallest element, where n is the length of the array.

// Forexample,if theinputarrayA=(3,2,1,5,4),thenA[3]isthefirstlargestelement in A, A[0]
// is the third largest element in A, and A[ 2] is the fifth largest element in A.

// Design an algorithm for computing the kth largest element in an array. Assume entries are distinct.

export function findKthLargest(list: number[], k: number) {}
