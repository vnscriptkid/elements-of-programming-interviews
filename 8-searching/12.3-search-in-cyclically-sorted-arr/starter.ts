// An array is said to be cyclically sorted if it is possible to cyclically shift its entries
// so that it becomes sorted.

// Design an O(logn) algorithm for finding the position of the smallest element in a cyclically sorted array.
// Assume all elements are distinct.
// For example, for the array in Figure 12.2 on the next page, your algorithm should return 4.
