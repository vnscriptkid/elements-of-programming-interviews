// THE BEDBATHANDBEYOND.COM PROBLEM

// Suppose you are designing a search engine.
// In addition to getting keywords from a page's content,
// you would like to get keywords from Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
// For example, bedbathandbeyond.com yields the keywords "bed, bath, beyond, bat, hand"
// the first two coming from the decomposition "bed bath beyond" and the latter two coming from the decomposition "bed bat hand beyond".

// Given a dictionary i.e., a set of strings, and a name, design an efficient algorithm
// that checks whether the name is the concatenation of a sequence of dictionary words.
// If such a concatenation exists, return it.
// A dictionary word may appear more than once in the sequence,
// e.g., "a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal" is a valid sequence for "amanaplanacanal".
