// 16.10 COMPUTE A GRAY CODE

// An n-bit Gray code is a permutation of {0,1, 2,...,2" - 1) such that the binary repÂ¬
// resentations of successive integers in the sequence differ in only one place. (This
// is with wraparound, i.e., the last and first elements must also differ in only one
// place.) 

// For example, both <(000)2,(100)2,(101)2,(111)2,(110)2,(010)2,(011)2,(001)2> =
// (0, 4,5, 7,6, 2,3, 1) and (0, 1,3, 2,6, 7,5, 4) are Gray codes for n = 3.

// Write a program which takes n asinput and returns an n-bit Gray code.
