// GENERATE ALL SUBSETS OF SIZE k

// There are a number of testing applications in which it is required to compute all
// subsets of a given size for a specified set.

// Write a program which computes all size k subsets of {1, 2,..., nj,
// where k and n are program inputs. For example, if k = 2 and n = 5,
// then the result is the following: ((1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5))
